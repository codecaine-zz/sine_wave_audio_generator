# Sine Wave Music Generator

This Python program generates a simple melody using sine waves and plays it through the sound card. The program uses the NumPy and simpleaudio libraries to generate and play the audio signal.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system, as well as the NumPy and simpleaudio libraries. You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

```bash
pip install simpleaudio numpy
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the program, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
python sine_wave_music.py
```

The program will generate a melody using sine waves and play it through the sound card. You can modify the frequency and duration of each note by changing the values of `notes_freq` and `duration` in the code.
